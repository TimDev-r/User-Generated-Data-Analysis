Approach:
The task involved implementing a personalized recommendation system based on user attributes such as country, age, gender, and registration date.
The goal was to recommend the top K popular items to a user that they have never seen before, considering users from the same country, age, gender, and registration year.

Algorithm:
The algorithm used a collaborative filtering approach to generate recommendations.
It started by calculating the global item-popularity distribution by summing the interactions across all users.
Items seen by the target user were identified by finding the indices of non-zero elements in the interaction array corresponding to the user.
The popularity scores of the seen items were forced to become 'unpopular' by setting their scores to zero in the item-popularity distribution.
The users from the same country, age, gender, and registration year as the target user were filtered from the user dataset.
For each user in the same group, the items they have seen were excluded from consideration by setting their popularity scores to zero.
The algorithm selected the top K items with the highest popularity scores as the recommendations for the target user.
The recommendations were returned as an array sorted in the order of descending popularity.

Experiments:
The implemented recommender system was tested using a simulated dataset with user attributes and interaction information.
Different scenarios were considered to evaluate the performance of the recommender system, including users from different countries, age groups, genders, and registration years.
The accuracy and effectiveness of the recommendations were measured by nDCG score.
